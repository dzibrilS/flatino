Flatino is a small real estate marketplace where users can post property listings, browse available offers, and contact sellers directly.  
The project focuses on simplicity, performance, and a clean user flow no unnecessary features, just what’s needed to get things done.

Built as a project to practice working on a complete app flow: listings, search, user accounts, messaging, and basic payments.
